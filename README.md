# 🧠 Face Classification using SVM

This project uses deep learning to classify faces using **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** on face embeddings generated by models like **FaceNet**. The model is trained on a custom dataset and can identify a person based on a 512-dimensional face embedding.

🚀 Workflow
Face Detection & Alignment – Uses MTCNN to crop and align faces from the dataset.

Embedding Extraction – Passes aligned faces through InceptionResnetV1 (FaceNet) to get 512-D embeddings.

SVM Training – Trains a linear SVM on scaled embeddings.

Prediction – Takes a test image, gets its embedding, predicts the label, and searches for matching images.

📈 Model Performance
